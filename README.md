# Princeton Algorithms 2 Subtitles
This project is an attempt to help manage the subtitle files for the Princeton Algorithms 2 course, currently hosted on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2).

## Overview
As I progress through the course, I'll be adding `.vtt` files from the lectures I cover.

If I notice that a part of the `.vtt` file for that lecture needs to be changed, I'll create a commit (usually one per slide), to help with cherry-picking in the case of ambiguous audio parsing.

Feel free to submit pull requests if you notice something that I've missed, this is a great way to make sure that the subtitles are correct and up to date.

## Other Languages
My primary language is English, so my contributions will be centered around fixing the English language subtitles.

Any English subtitle files will end with the filetype `eng.vtt`, in accordance with [ISO 639-2/T Language Coding](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php).

If you'd like to submit subtitles in a different language (which would be *awesome*), please adhere to the [ISO 639-2/T Language Coding](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) table to avoid [collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(computer_science)).  
So, for example, if you'd like to submit Spanish subtitles, your filetypes should end with `spa.vtt`.  
As another example, if you'd like to submit Chinese subtitles, your filetypes should end with `zho.vtt` (and not `chi.vtt`, since we're using the Terminology ISO set [and not](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/faq.html#3) the Bibliographic ISO set).
