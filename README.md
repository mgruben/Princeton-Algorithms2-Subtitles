# Princeton Algorithms 2 Subtitles
This project is an attempt to help manage the subtitle files for the Princeton Algorithms 2 course, currently hosted on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2).

## Overview
As I progress through the course, I'll be adding `.vtt` files from the lectures I cover.

If I notice that a part of the `.vtt` file for that lecture needs to be changed, I'll create a commit (usually one per slide), to help with cherry-picking in the case of ambiguous audio parsing.

Feel free to submit pull requests if you notice something that I've missed, this is a great way to make sure that the subtitles are correct and up to date.

## Other Languages
Should you want to contribute a translation of the subtitles (i.e. in a language other than English), please do so through [Coursera's Platform](https://translate-coursera.org/) for subtitle translation.
